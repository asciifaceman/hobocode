# Hobocode

Simply a very small wrapper for [go-pretty](https://github.com/jedib0t/go-pretty) for different opinionated colored print calls like Info() and Error()

This is meant to be a very simple utility for CLI applications relying on UX rather than structured log outputs.

# Example

```
import (
    "github.com/asciifaceman/hobocode"

    func main() {
            
    }
)
```
